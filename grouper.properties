# Grouper uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from grouper.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the grouper.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the grouper.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to the grouper.properties

# A wheel group allows you to enable non-GrouperSystem subjects to act
# like a root user when interacting with the registry.
groups.wheel.use = true

# Set to the name of the group you want to treat as the wheel group.
# The members of this group will be treated as root-like users.
groups.wheel.group = etc:sysadmingroup

# To automatically create the wheel group :
configuration.autocreate.system.groups = true

# Use the old gsh shell
gsh.useLegacy = true
